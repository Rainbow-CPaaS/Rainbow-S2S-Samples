 * # Rainbow authentication portal API guide  ## Preamble  [Download Postman collection][0]  ### Introduction  This guide describes list of API services that are provided by OT Rainbow authentication portal system. Services are used to manage OT Rainbow authentication.  ### Protocol  REST interface is used for sending/receiving OT rainbow API messages.   HTTP request GET is used. Standard HTTP responses are used to provide requested information or error status. There is no session notion in OT Rainbow system, so requests could be issued according stateless model, without transport conservation between them.   JSON is used as a main format for data encoding in message body part. Each request is started with the following pattern /{module}/{version}/ where {module} is a portal module name to address and {version} is a version of used API, par example, “v1.0”.  ### Security considerations  Each request should contain some credential information to authenticate itself. Standard HTTP authentication with basic/bearer modes is used. JSON Web Token mechanism is used to provide authentication information. JWT has a expire timeout that is controlled by OT Rainbow portal to prevent very long token usage. Also authentication with application token is used. The token must be provided in the request HTTP header, using a custom header: APIKey. At server side, token is verified, and if it doesn’t match, 403 Not Allowed response is sent. TLS is used as a transport protocol to support message exchanges between OT Rainbow portal and an application.    [0]: AuthenticationPortalServer_postman.json

     * Get a JWT from an id_token
     *
     * This endpoints allows applications to get a Rainbow JWT from an OpenID Connect (OIDC) id_token.  This API has to be used when OIDC implicit flow is used (see details in OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specifications, [section 3.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth)) or when the OIDC id_token is retrieved by other way than using [GET /api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/oidc-client/login](#api-OIDC_Client-GetOidcLogin) API.  Authorization code grant is **recommended** as it is more secure than Implicit grant (it involves a clientSecret from Rainbow application). &lt;br/&gt; However, some applications may prefer to implement the OIDC flow directly in their application, or some OIDC providers may not support authorization code grant. &lt;br/&gt; This API is dedicated to such cases, where the OIDC flow is completely handled outside of Rainbow plateform and the obtained id_token is used to generate a Rainbow JWT in order to use the Rainbow APIs.  In order to use this API, the OIDC SingleSignOn settings of the company must contain:  - &#x60;clientId&#x60;: the client_id for the Rainbow application created on the company&#39;s OIDC provider,  - &#x60;issuer&#x60;: the company&#39;s OIDC provider issuer (should has been got from discoveryUrl if OIDC    settings has been configured with this parameter).  - &#x60;jwksUri&#x60;: the company&#39;s OIDC provider jwks_uri endpoint (should has been got from discoveryUrl if OIDC    settings has been configured with this parameter).  The id_token must be valid and contain an &#x60;email&#x60; field corresponding to the &#x60;loginEmail&#x60; of a Rainbow user.  The full OIDC flow using Implicit grant is detailed in the following sequence diagram. &lt;br/&gt; This GET /api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/oidc-client/jwt endpoint addresses point 8 of this diagram (point 1 to 7 are addressed outside of Rainbow platform). ![Failed to load diagram :-(](img/oidc-client_implicit_grant_flow_sd.png \&quot;OIDC client Implicit Flow grant sequence diagram\&quot;)  Details about the sequence diagram: - (1) User starts application - [optional] (2) Application requests Rainbow Authentication portal’s API [GET /api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/urls?uid&#x3D;user@company.com](#api-Authentication_Urls-GetLoginUrl)   to know what is the authentication type to use for this user. - (3) In the case the authentication type is OIDC for this user and company SSO setting &#x60;onlyUseImplicitFlow&#x60; is   set to true, or the developer wants to handle the OIDC flow directly in his application, the OIDC implicit flow is   handled outside of Rainbow platform.     - (3) The application redirects the browser / open a webview to the OIDC server’s authorize endpoint,     - (4) OIDC server display the login page,     - (5) The user enter his credentials in the OIDC server’s login page,     - (6) OIDC server redirects to client&#39;s redirect_uri (configured in OIDC server) with an id_token,     - (7) The application verifies the received id_token (see details in OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specifications, [section 3.1.3.7](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDTokenValidation)), - (8) The application calls API GET /api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/oidc-client/jwt with the id_token to get   a Rainbow JWT. This API performs the following validations:     - verify the application using x-rainbow-app-auth header     - ensure id_token is well a JWT and decode it to extract the user email     - ensure a user exists in Rainbow with this email as loginEmail and ensure his company has SSO OIDC settings     - validate the signature, issuer and audience of the id_token using company SSO OIDC settings     - If the validation succeed, a Rainbow JWT is returned in response, with the loggedInUser and loggedInApplication       objects (same response than the one returned by [GET /api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/login API](#api-Authentication-GetBasicLogin) - (9) Rainbow JWT can be use to call Rainbow APIs
