/**
 * Rainbow admin portal
 * # Rainbow administrator portal API guide  ## Preamble  ### Introduction  This guide describes list of API services that are provided by OT Rainbow management portal system. Services are used to manage OT Rainbow system entities  ### Protocol  REST interface is used for sending/receiving OT rainbow API messages. HTTP requests GET, DELETE, POST, UPDATE are used. Standard HTTP responses are used to provide requested information or error status. There is no session notion in OT Rainbow system, so requests could be issued according stateless model, without transport conservation between them. Additional data could be provided in message body. JSON is used as a main format for data encoding in message body part. Each request is started with the following pattern /{module}/{version}/ where {module} is a portal module name to address and {version} is a version of used API, par example, “v1.0”.  ### Security considerations  Each request should contain some credential information to authenticate itself. Standard HTTP authentication with basic/bearer modes is used. JSON Web Token mechanism is used to provide authentication information. JWT has a expire timeout that is controlled by OT Rainbow portal to prevent very long token usage. Also authentication with application token is used. The token must be provided in the request HTTP header, using a custom header: APIKey. At server side, token is verified, and if it doesn’t match, 403 Not Allowed response is sent. TLS is used as a transport protocol to support message exchanges between OT Rainbow portal and an application.

     * Get all systems

This corresponds to **OTEC-S OXEs**, which are multi-tenant.    A multi-tenant system, so called **centrex**, allows sharing a call-server between several entities by setting the flag `isCentrex=true` on the system. This flag is set during the system creation and can't be changed (the system would have to be deleted first and then re-created without the flag isCentrex).    For Rainbow, an entity is a site with the flag `isCentrex=true` linked to a company with the flag `isCentrex=true` (the company and site must both have the flag isCentrex=true to be linked to a system with isCentrex=true).    A company with the flag isCentrex=true can only have a single site (the site will have automatically the flag isCentrex=true when it is created).    Getting a list having the status isCentrex=true is possible using query parameter filter `isCentrex`. * Since 1.73.0 release, configuring companies sharing a **multi-company** system is possible.    A shared multi-company system, so called **shared**, allows sharing a call-server between several sites from different companies.    No specific configuration is applied on the PBX, the specific configuration is only on Rainbow side, by setting the flag `isShared=true` on the system. This flag is set during the system creation and can't be changed (the system would have to be deleted first and then re-created without the flag isShared).    It is understood that this approach exposes all users of the PBX to all companies that have users on this PBX (for association, for dial by name). Anyway it seats on a PBX infra where all PBX users can directly dial (by short num and DBN) any other users of the network from their deskphones.    A site being linked to such systems can be linked to other systems (shared or not, but not centrex).    Getting a list having the status isShared=true is possible using query parameter filter `isShared`. * It is possible to get the list of systems being shared **or** centrex using query parameter filter `isSharedOrCentrex`.  
     * @param {String} accept application/json
     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters

     * @param {Number} opts.limit Allow to specify the number of systems to retrieve.
     * @param {Number} opts.offset Allow to specify the position of first system to retrieve (first site if not specified). Warning: if offset > total, no results are returned.
     * @param {String} opts.sortField Sort system list based on the given field.
     * @param {Number} opts.sortOrder Specify order when sorting pbx list.
     * @param {String} opts.name Allows to filter systems list on field name.

Ex: if filtering is done on _oxe1_, systems with the following names are match the filter 'OXE1', 'Oxe1', 'My oxe1', 'oxe12', 'My OXE12', ...

     * Create a system
     * This API allows administrator to create a system.    A system hosts the CCA (Call Control Agent) configuration.       `superadmin` can create systems linked to all sites existing in Rainbow.    `bp_admin` can only create systems linked to sites of End Customer companies for which their bp_admin's company is the BP company.    `organization_admin` can only create systems linked to sites of companies under their organisation.    `company_admin` can only create systems linked to sites of their company.    `site_admin` can only create the systems linked to the site they administrate.       **Specific feature:** Sharing a system between several companies   * Since 1.47.0 release, configuring companies sharing a **multi-tenant** system is possible.    This corresponds to **OTEC-S OXEs**, which are multi-tenant.    A multi-tenant system, so called **centrex**, allows sharing a call-server between several entities by setting the flag `isCentrex=true` on the system. This flag is set during the system creation and can't be changed (the system would have to be deleted first and then re-created without the flag isCentrex).    For Rainbow, an entity is a site with the flag `isCentrex=true` linked to a company with the flag `isCentrex=true` (the company and site must both have the flag isCentrex=true to be linked to a system with isCentrex=true).    A company with the flag isCentrex=true can only have a single site (the site will have automatically the flag isCentrex=true when it is created).    Getting a list having the status isCentrex=true is possible using query parameter filter `isCentrex`. * Since 1.73.0 release, configuring companies sharing a **multi-company** system is possible.    A shared multi-company system, so called **shared**, allows sharing a call-server between several sites from different companies.    No specific configuration is applied on the PBX, the specific configuration is only on Rainbow side, by setting the flag `isShared=true` on the system. This flag is set during the system creation and can't be changed (the system would have to be deleted first and then re-created without the flag isShared).    It is understood that this approach exposes all users of the PBX to all companies that have users on this PBX (for association, for dial by name). Anyway it seats on a PBX infra where all PBX users can directly dial (by short num and DBN) any other users of the network from their deskphones.    A site being linked to such systems can be linked to other systems (shared or not, but not centrex).    Getting a list having the status isShared=true is possible using query parameter filter `isShared`. * It is possible to get the list of systems being shared **or** centrex using query parameter filter `isSharedOrCentrex`.
